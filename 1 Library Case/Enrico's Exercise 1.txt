Enrico's Exercise 1:
🧩 Exercise: Text and Sentence Analysis (Procedural Version)
🧠 Objective
Write a Python program that analyzes a short piece of text entered by the user.
The program should work without using functions or classes — just simple variables, loops, and conditionals.
 
🧮 Program requirements
Your program should:
1. Ask the user to enter a text.
	Example input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The fox was quick and clever!
2. Split the text into sentences.
	For this exercise, you can assume that sentences end with ., !, or ?.
3. For each sentence:
	- Count the number of words in the sentence.
	- Find the three most frequent words in that sentence and their number of occurrences.
4. Compute totals for the entire text:
	- Total number of sentences.
	- Total number of words.
	- The three most frequent words overall (across all sentences).
5. Display the results clearly, for example:
